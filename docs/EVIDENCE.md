## Superseding branch-policy decision

After approving [Zero PR20](https://github.com/codepetca/zero/pull/20) and
[Community PR5](https://github.com/codepetca/zero-community/pull/5), the owner
explicitly requested removal of GitHub branch protections. Both main protection
records were deleted; authenticated GET returned404 `Branch not protected` for
each repository and both ruleset lists were empty. Earlier protection receipts
below are historical. The JSON snapshots do not enforce or restore settings.
This decision changes GitHub enforcement only; Community acceptance-helper
requirements, CI, reviewed runtime source and published release bytes are unchanged.

## Published 2026-10-10

[Community 0.1.3](https://github.com/codepetca/zero-community/releases/tag/v0.1.3)
was published from `7d4fa181d07f320cc4a305f60636e81aab9a9bcb` after
[source PR3](https://github.com/codepetca/zero-community/pull/3) and successful
Component checks. [Publication record PR4](https://github.com/codepetca/zero-community/pull/4)
produced main `f6460f48f6c3ba5ae1c842f40324b44f5dbfa712`.

SourceDigest `388dd646ae188f30f91df6404f126d6857fe9f292926c658ba7418f5f3a76c34`.
Two reproducible library builds,6JavaFX checks,4actual consumers and all9public
artifact download sizes/SHA256s passed. Existing0.1.2 assets were preserved.
The portable Workshop binds Zero source `4e2eb8dac680578eeab1804106a55744fec77f5c`
and Community source above;81members,243011bytes,
SHA256 `da507795c4e935e1fced1230ed32ba8f35eaf85e868328cf5b086061af70fa50`.

Independent source/publication reviews were coordinated by Zero. The publication
record/canonical catalog review at Community `a97b98961310826020734e240565048fef4105f1`
requested GPT-6.1-Sol/high, complete with no blockers. This is an AI-assisted source
review, not an authenticated human contribution approval. Both health bars remain
experimental MIT/null maintainer; no Community acceptance or core promotion.

Full local receipts stay ignored in sibling Zero's
`.verification/publication-2026-10-10/`; Zero's tracked `docs/EVIDENCE.md` indexes
all source/catalog/download PRs and review turns. Public releases preserve bytes.
Physical Windows/Linux editor/setup/input, audible sound and novice classroom use
remain unverified. CI/synthetic native checks do not establish those behaviours.
No live AI provider was used. Historical records are in
[the handoff archive](history/ai-handoff-through-2026-10-10.md).

## AI boundary remediation

Audit at main `f6460f48`:35admission tests and13mocked acceptance/release tests
passed. Additional reproductions found no-op workflow trust, outbound JSON byte
budget mismatch and boolean schema acceptance. Remediation passes39admission and25acceptance/release tests. Library source
digest is unchanged. Independent final-source review completed with no unresolved blockers.

## GitHub main protection — 2026-10-10

Owner authorized enforcement after the audit. Authenticated API readback confirms
1current human approval, stale-approval dismissal and latest-push approval by
another human, strict up-to-date GitHub Actions `check` from app15368,
resolved conversations, admin enforcement and no review bypass/force push/deletion.
The settings snapshot is [main-protection.json](../.github/main-protection.json).
Named [CODEOWNERS](../.github/CODEOWNERS) is local until its human-reviewed merge.
Readback JSON is retained locally in Zero .verification/ai-flow-hardening-2026-10-10.
Initial API request was rejected422 with both contexts/checks; corrected checks-only
request applied successfully. No account identity, credentials or release bytes changed.

## Independent remediation review — initial wave

`ai_hardening_security_review/turn1` (correctness) reviewed Community `f6460f48..a120d2cb` and Zero rules at
`49385146`; `ai_hardening_compat_review/turn1` reviewed both complete `f8f78290..49385146` and
`f6460f48..a120d2cb` diffs. Requested GPT-6.1-Sol/high in two fresh contexts;
effective configuration/tokens/elapsed telemetry unknown. Both assigned scopes
complete. Accepted two P2 corrections: final PR/review/role readback and accurate
publisher stop/resume documentation. First correction batch passes25acceptance
regressions (15.202seconds), retaining39admission tests and unchanged source digest.
Targeted independent review completed for both correction deltas. Main protection
was absent (authenticated404 `Branch not protected`, repository rulesets empty)
before applying the stronger gate; the apply script rechecked that baseline.

## Accepted local hardening delivery

`ai_hardening_security_review/turn2` covered Community `a120d2cb..6be28609fae074b1e0d8b51d142b8e1c5a4b842b`
and Zero `49385146..1d37a70276843a695a5a83fc0ebdbf5cbf92d79b`, requested
GPT-6.1-Sol/high. Complete correction scope, both accepted P2 findings resolved,
no new blockers; five focused race cases passed in2.173seconds. Initial unchanged
policy/AI and compatibility coverage remains applicable; no extra integration wave.

Final checks:39admission,25acceptance/release,43Zero release and24site tests pass;
Zero configuration/links/types/production build pass. Current CLI emits33,875UTF-8
request bytes, no provider call; library source digest unchanged. GitHub protection
was read back again after review, matching the intended gate. Histories match the
original revisions except archive headers/rebased links. Primary funding work untouched.

Review ledger:2initial turns+1targeted turn,1fix batch,0failed reviewer launches;
effective models/attributable tokens/worker elapsed telemetry unknown. Conservative
review budget clock01:06:06–01:12:04UTC (~6minutes), not measured worker/coordination
cost. Implementation worker estimated12minutes+4minutes correction; those estimates
are not a claim of savings. No source push/PR/merge, new release or live AI provider.
Final receipt-only state edits are coordinator-checked; runtime source is unchanged
from the reviewed revisions. Code-owner file selection takes effect after human merge.
